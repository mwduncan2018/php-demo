There is a blank version of the database used for the Python automated test.
socialnetworkdb1_structure_only

The PHP site runs on this database.
socialnetworkdb1

The prod data is backed up in this database.
socialnetworkdb1_prod

For testing, copy "socialnetworkdb1_structure_only" as "socialnetworkdb1"
AND all Images must be temporarily removed from the Images folder
on the server. That is why these images are in this BACKUP folder.

For prod, copy "socialnetworkdb1_prod" as "socialnetworkdb1"
AND move the Images from this BACKUP folder into the Images folder.
